We have uploaded a zip file [containing ORCA software and information (click here)](https://cornell.box.com/shared/static/h51z9sb9rqpzgouf0qqp3xqwnwcyxsq5.zip), courtesy of Prof. Mattar.
Please also see the [appendix for the workshop](https://cornell.box.com/s/h51z9sb9rqpzgouf0qqp3xqwnwcyxsq5){:target="_blank"} that he has posted online.
Note that this information and software is not contained in the VM, so you will likely want to download it.
