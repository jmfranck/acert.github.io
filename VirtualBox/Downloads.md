## VM Image of Linux System

Now ready for download!  We have uploaded the image files onto [Cornell Box (click here to download)](https://cornell.box.com/s/o47ptx9wr21ui15zbugjizjanz24jk6c) as a multipart zip image.

Don't click the file name or the large download icon at the top of the page.  Rather, follow the illustration below to get a direct download:  
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/box_info.png)  
Do this for all the CentOS* files.

To verify the download and help unpack the image you can save [this shell script]({{ site.url }}/assets/unpack_linux_vm.sh) in the same directory.  It should run in a Unix/Mac shell (feedback welcome), and will run on windows if you have git (open bash shell and type `bash unpack_linux_vm.sh`.)

See the [VirtualBox]({{ site.url }}/VirtualBox.html) page to complete the installation.

## Delay in Upload of Windows Image 

Our upload bandwidth is ***much*** slower than we anticipated, so the Windows will be uploaded on the night of Saturday, June 6<sup>th</sup>.

Please try out the Linux image as soon as you can so there is still time to report back with problems!
