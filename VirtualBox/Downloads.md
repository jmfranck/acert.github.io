##Some notes as of 2 PM Saturday:

- The shell script was modified + broken this morning, but should now be fixed for Windows, and may or may not work for Mac.
    - (Mac notes:) We don't have a Mac to test it on, have modified based on some feedback, but it might still give very strange errors. If you have a Mac, you might just want to check md5 checksums manually.
- ***The first upload in the series was broken -- please download the others while we re-upload the CentOS_final.zip.001 file***

## VM Image of Linux System

**Currently diagnosing issues with unpacking script**
*Please download the files, but we are working on fixing the verification script (Sat 1:24pm)*

Now ready for download!  We have uploaded the image files onto [Cornell Box (click here to download)](https://cornell.box.com/s/o47ptx9wr21ui15zbugjizjanz24jk6c){:target="_blank"} as a multipart zip image.

Don't click the file name or the large download icon at the top of the page.  Rather, follow the illustration below to get a direct download:  
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/box_info.png)  
Do this for all the CentOS* files.

To verify the download and help unpack the image you can save [this shell script]({{ site.url }}/assets/unpack_linux_vm.sh) in the same directory.  It will run on windows if you have git (open bash shell and type `bash unpack_linux_vm.sh`; see [NLSL page]({{ site.url }}/Software/NLSL.html) for install instructions), and should run on Mac or Linux (feeback welcome).  If the script doesn't work for you, you can check the md5 sums [manually](http://www.droidviews.com/check-md5sum-of-a-file-on-windows-mac-and-linux/){:target="_blank"}:

 file name  | md5
:----------:|:-----------:
CentOS_final.zip.001" | e48bc26a8717747be1327fa5ccdcfa30
CentOS_final.zip.002 | c6906ad40272c6e4a6fa0d06a3d6f4d2
CentOS_final.zip.003 | e3969d997b73c28856f1644b542212f7
CentOS_final.zip.004 | cafbb83a5032cc750c53adea266f915f
CentOS_final.ova | b436e96942700b2420c057cb702d234f

The final file above is the unpacked result.
If you have any issues with unpacking or installing, please check the md5 sum first!

See the [VirtualBox]({{ site.url }}/VirtualBox.html) page to complete the installation.

*12:30pm Saturday -- updated shell script, which had some problems â†’ verified install of unpacked ova image on Windows*

## Delay in Upload of Windows Image 

Our upload bandwidth is ***much*** slower than we anticipated, so the Windows will be uploaded on the night of Saturday, June 6<sup>th</sup>.

Please try out the Linux image as soon as you can so there is still time to report back with problems!
