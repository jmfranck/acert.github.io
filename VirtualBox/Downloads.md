## VM Image of Linux System

Now ready for download!  We have uploaded the image files onto [Cornell Box (click here to download)](https://cornell.box.com/s/o47ptx9wr21ui15zbugjizjanz24jk6c) as a multipart zip image.

Don't click the file name or the large download icon at the top of the page.  Rather, follow the illustration below to get a direct download:  
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/box_info.png)  
Do this for all the CentOS* files.

To verify the download and help unpack the image you can save [this shell script]() in the same directory.  It should run in a Unix/Mac shell (feedback welcome), and will run on windows if you have git (open bash shell and type `bash unpack_linux_vm.sh`.)

See the [VirtualBox]({{ site.url }}/VirtualBox.html) page to complete the installation.

## Delay in Upload of Windows Image 

We apologize -- our upload bandwidth is ***much*** slower than we anticipated, so the windows will be uploaded tomorrow.

Please try out the Linux image as soon as you can so there is still time to report back with problems!
