We have set up two [VirtualBox]({{ site.url }}/VirtualBox.html) VMs (one Linux, one Windows) that the workshop attendees can install on their laptops in order to follow along with the presentations.

We are asking for your help to get your software installed onto these VMs.  An instance of each is running on a computer in our lab and connected to the web via TeamViewer.

1. If you don't have it, please download and install [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/)
1. We emailed you the information that you need to connect to the appropriate VM.
    * Currently, Matlab is only installed on the Linux version.  If your software will *only* run on Matlab for Windows, please let us know.
1. Connect to the TeamViewer partner ID that you were emailed
    * The *password* is the same as the root/admin password.
1. Install your software as normal.
    * The LabView SPI (Windows), Matlab (Linux), and EasySpin (Linux) were installed when the VM was set up.
    * Firefox should work as normal, allowing you to download the software onto the machine.  Please let us know what changes you make to the software.
    * As you install, please take this as an opportunity to format installation instructions for those who want to install the software directly on their computer.  Please email this to the address below. (Please email source documents, not PDFs)
1. Run the software that you will want to demonstrate during the workshop.
    * Again, please take the opportunity to document a basic test example that users can use *merely to insure that the software is working*.

Please address all technical concerns to jmf356[at]cornell.edu
