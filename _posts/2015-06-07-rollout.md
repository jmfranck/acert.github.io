If you have not done so, you need to [install VirtualBox]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox.html) immediately.

The Linux VM Image is now available is now available for [download (click here)]({{site.url}}/VirtualBox/Downloads.html).

The Windows VM Image will be available later this evening -- since they take time to download, we truly hope everyone will download and install the Linux VM first.

We are expecting that everyone will come to the workshop with both the Windows and Linux VMs running and able to open Matlab.
There will unfortunately not be time to resolve issues during the workshop, so don't hesitate to **contact us now**.
